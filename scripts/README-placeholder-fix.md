# Fix for Placeholder Display Issue

## 🚨 Problem:
The app is not showing placeholder images and "Deleted Item" text for deleted products and users.

## 🔍 Root Cause:
1. **Database columns missing**: `is_deleted` and `product_deleted` columns don't exist
2. **Frontend queries failing**: Services trying to access non-existent columns
3. **Placeholder logic not working**: Missing graceful fallbacks

## ✅ Solutions Applied:

### 1. **Database Fix**
- ✅ Created `scripts/quick-fix-database.sql` to add missing columns
- ✅ Added graceful fallbacks for missing columns in services
- ✅ Updated queries to handle missing columns

### 2. **Frontend Fixes**
- ✅ **MessageService**: Added graceful handling for missing `product_deleted` column
- ✅ **ChatScreen**: Added graceful handling for missing `product_deleted` column
- ✅ **ConversationsScreen**: Already has proper placeholder logic
- ✅ **ProductService**: Removed problematic `is_deleted` references

### 3. **Placeholder Logic**
- ✅ **Product deletion**: Shows "Deleted Item" + `deleted_product_placeholder.webp`
- ✅ **User deletion**: Shows "Deleted Account" + `deleted_user_placeholder.png`
- ✅ **Graceful fallbacks**: Handles missing database columns

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix:

### Step 1: Fix Database (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- scripts/quick-fix-database.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix
```sql
-- Run this to verify columns exist:
-- scripts/test-placeholder-display.sql
```

### Step 3: Manual Test
1. **Mark a product as deleted** (for testing):
   ```sql
   UPDATE products SET is_deleted = true WHERE id = 'your-product-id';
   UPDATE conversations SET product_deleted = true WHERE product_id = 'your-product-id';
   ```

2. **Check the app**:
   - Conversations screen should show "Deleted Item"
   - Product image should show placeholder
   - Chat screen should show placeholder images

## 📱 Expected Behavior:

### **Conversations Screen:**
- ✅ **Deleted Product**: Shows "Deleted Item" + placeholder image
- ✅ **Deleted User**: Shows "Deleted Account" + placeholder avatar
- ✅ **Product Image**: Shows `deleted_product_placeholder.webp`
- ✅ **User Avatar**: Shows `deleted_user_placeholder.png`

### **Chat Screen:**
- ✅ **Product Info**: Shows "Deleted Item" + placeholder image
- ✅ **User Info**: Shows "Deleted Account" + placeholder avatar
- ✅ **Cannot send messages** to deleted users

### **Product Details:**
- ✅ **Deleted Product**: Shows placeholder image
- ✅ **Deleted User**: Shows placeholder avatar
- ✅ **Proper messaging**: Cannot message deleted users

## 🧪 Testing Checklist:

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ No placeholder images shown
- ❌ Database errors when accessing missing columns
- ❌ "Deleted Item" not displayed
- ❌ "Deleted Account" not displayed

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Placeholder images display correctly
- ✅ "Deleted Item" shows for deleted products
- ✅ "Deleted Account" shows for deleted users
- ✅ No database errors
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing data

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### **If placeholders still don't show:**

1. **Check database columns**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'products' AND column_name = 'is_deleted';
   ```

2. **Check conversation data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT product_id, product_deleted FROM conversations 
   WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Verify placeholder files exist**:
   - `assets/deleted_product_placeholder.webp`
   - `assets/deleted_user_placeholder.png`

4. **Check app logs** for any errors

### **If still having issues:**

1. **Restart the app** after database changes
2. **Clear app cache** if needed
3. **Check network connectivity**
4. **Verify Supabase connection**
