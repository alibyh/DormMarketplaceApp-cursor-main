# Manual Product Deletion Handling

## 🎯 Goal:
When a user **manually deletes their product** through the app (using the delete button), the conversations and chat screens should show placeholder images and "Deleted Item" text.

## 🔧 Complete Solution:

### **1. Database Setup (Run First)**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- scripts/add-product-deletion-trigger.sql
```

### **2. Code Changes Made:**

#### **ProductService.js:**
- ✅ **Updated `deleteProduct` function** to also update conversations
- ✅ **Added conversation update** when product is soft deleted
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** for missing columns

#### **AccountScreen.js:**
- ✅ **Updated `handleDeleteBuyOrder` function** to use soft delete
- ✅ **Added conversation update** for buy order deletion
- ✅ **Fallback to hard delete** if soft delete not available

#### **MessageService.js:**
- ✅ **Added `product_deleted` to queries**
- ✅ **Graceful handling** for missing columns
- ✅ **Proper `is_deleted` flag setting**

#### **ChatScreen.js:**
- ✅ **Added graceful handling** for missing `product_deleted`
- ✅ **Proper placeholder image display**
- ✅ **"Deleted Item" text display**

### **3. Database Triggers:**
- ✅ **Automatic conversation updates** when products are deleted
- ✅ **Works for both products and buy orders**
- ✅ **Handles both soft and hard deletes**

## 🧪 Testing Process:

### **Step 1: Setup Database**
```sql
-- Run the trigger script
-- scripts/add-product-deletion-trigger.sql
```

### **Step 2: Test Product Deletion**
1. **Find a product ID** from the database
2. **Delete the product** through the app (using delete button)
3. **Check conversations** - should show placeholders
4. **Open chat** - should show placeholders

### **Step 3: Manual Database Test**
```sql
-- Run the test script
-- scripts/test-manual-product-deletion.sql
```

### **Step 4: Verify Placeholders**
- ✅ **Conversations screen**: Shows "Deleted Item" + placeholder image
- ✅ **Chat screen**: Shows "Deleted Item" + placeholder image
- ✅ **No database errors** in console

## 📱 Expected Behavior:

### **When User Deletes Product:**

#### **1. Product Deletion Process:**
1. User clicks delete button on product
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Product is soft deleted (`is_deleted = true`)
4. Conversations are updated (`product_deleted = true`)
5. Database trigger ensures consistency

#### **2. Conversations Screen:**
- ✅ **Product name**: Shows "Deleted Item"
- ✅ **Product image**: Shows `deleted_product_placeholder.webp`
- ✅ **User info**: Shows normal user info (not deleted)
- ✅ **Conversation**: Still accessible and functional

#### **3. Chat Screen:**
- ✅ **Product info card**: Shows "Deleted Item" + placeholder
- ✅ **Chat functionality**: Still works normally
- ✅ **Messages**: Preserved and accessible
- ✅ **User interaction**: Can still send/receive messages

#### **4. Product Details:**
- ✅ **Product image**: Shows placeholder
- ✅ **Product name**: Shows "Deleted Item"
- ✅ **Messaging**: Still works (if conversation exists)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### **If placeholders don't show:**

#### **1. Check Database Columns:**
```sql
-- Verify columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'products' AND column_name = 'is_deleted';

SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'conversations' AND column_name = 'product_deleted';
```

#### **2. Check Product Deletion:**
```sql
-- Verify product is marked as deleted
SELECT id, name, is_deleted FROM products WHERE id = 'your-product-id';
```

#### **3. Check Conversation Updates:**
```sql
-- Verify conversation was updated
SELECT product_id, product_deleted FROM conversations 
WHERE product_id = 'your-product-id';
```

#### **4. Check Triggers:**
```sql
-- Verify triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%deletion%';
```

### **If still having issues:**

1. **Restart the app** after database changes
2. **Clear app cache** if needed
3. **Check console logs** for any errors
4. **Verify Supabase connection**

## 📝 Code Flow:

### **Product Deletion Flow:**
```
User clicks delete → Confirmation dialog → 
deleteProduct() → Soft delete product → 
Update conversations → Database trigger → 
Frontend shows placeholders
```

### **Conversation Display Flow:**
```
getConversations() → Check product_deleted → 
If deleted: Show "Deleted Item" + placeholder → 
If not deleted: Show normal product info
```

### **Chat Display Flow:**
```
fetchProductInfoFromConversation() → 
Check product_deleted → 
If deleted: Show "Deleted Item" + placeholder → 
If not deleted: Show normal product info
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria:

- ✅ **Database columns exist** and are populated
- ✅ **Triggers work** automatically
- ✅ **Placeholder images show** for deleted products
- ✅ **"Deleted Item" text shows** for deleted products
- ✅ **Conversations remain functional** after product deletion
- ✅ **No database errors** in console
- ✅ **App works smoothly** without crashes

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Run the database trigger script**
2. **Test product deletion** through the app
3. **Verify placeholders display** correctly
4. **Test conversation functionality** after deletion
5. **Monitor for any issues**

## 📋 Testing Checklist:

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ No placeholder images shown for deleted products
- ❌ "Deleted Item" not displayed
- ❌ Database errors when accessing missing columns
- ❌ Inconsistent deletion status

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Placeholder images display correctly
- ✅ "Deleted Item" shows for deleted products
- ✅ Database triggers work automatically
- ✅ No database errors
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing data
- ✅ Conversations remain functional

The manual product deletion should now work perfectly with proper placeholder display! 🎉
