-- SQL script to enable real-time capabilities in Supabase
-- Run this in the SQL Editor to enable real-time triggers for messages and conversations

-- First, check if the supabase_realtime schema exists

-- Then, enable the realtime publication if not already enabled
CREATE PUBLICATION IF NOT EXISTS supabase_realtime

-- Check if the tables are included in the publication

-- Ensure the conversations table is added to the publication
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE conversations;

-- Ensure the messages table is added to the publication

-- Enable for conversations table
